## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### Q: I'm not technical. Can I really do this?
**A:** YES! WordPress is designed for non-technical people. The plugins do the heavy lifting. If you can use Microsoft Word, you can use WordPress. Plus there are tons of YouTube tutorials for every step.

### Q: How much time per week after launch?
**A:** Week 1-8: 15-25 hours/week
After launch: 5-10 hours/week (adding content, responding to community)

### Q: What if no one subscribes?
**A:** Start with friends/family. Build email list before launch. The natural health/wellness market is HUGE. With good SEO and marketing, you'll get subscribers. Start with modest goals (10 subscribers month 1).

### Q: Do I need to know how to code?
**A:** No coding required! WordPress + plugins handle everything.

### Q: Can I do this part-time?
**A:** Absolutely! Most successful sites started as side projects.

### Q: What if I make a mistake?
**A:** Backups! UpdraftPlus backs everything up. You can always restore. Plus hosting companies have backups too.

### Q: How do I handle legal/medical concerns?
**A:** Clear disclaimers on every page. Make it educational, not medical advice. Consult with a lawyer if concerned (about $500 for review).

### Q: Should I start with free or paid only?
**A:** Offer both! Free tier (3-5 recipes) builds trust and converts to paid. Called "freemium" model - proven to work.
